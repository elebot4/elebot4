## About me 

I am a PhD candidate in Medical Imaging at the University of Bordeaux (LaBRI lab), working on fine-grained brain segmentation from FLAIR MRI.  
My PhD research focuses on developing robust segmentation methods for clinical neuroimaging, with a special interest in application to FLAIR images in presence of disease related anomalies.
