# Edern Le Bot

Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in Medical Imaging at the University of Bordeaux, working in the [In2Brain team](https://in2brain.labri.fr/) at LaBRI. I'm currently wrapping up my thesis on fine-grained brain segmentation using FLAIR MRI. My research focused on developing robust, clinically applicable segmentation methods that work even in the presence of disease-related anomalies.

Note that most of the code from my PhD is not publicly released at this time.
