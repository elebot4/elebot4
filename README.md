# Edern Le Bot

I'm a PhD candidate in Medical Imaging at the University of Bordeaux (LaBRI lab), currently wrapping up my thesis on fine-grained brain segmentation using FLAIR MRI.  
My research focused on developing robust, clinically applicable segmentation methods that work even in the presence of disease-related anomalies.

Note that most of the code from my PhD is not publicly released at this time.
